The Natix Network is a decentralized subnet designed to identify elements of construction sites in images. Built on Bittensor, this subnet incentivizes miners to develop and deploy models that accurately detect construction-related features like road signs, hazard markings, and machinery.

## Decentralized Detection of Driving Qualia
Who hasn't been late to work for reasons outside of your control? Roadwork, lane closures, accidents, weather, and other unforeseen circumstances can cause any number of annoyances. Centralized map providers cannot be everywhere at once, and they
The Natix Network focuses on detecting elements of construction sites in images, such as road signs, hazard markings, construction materials, and machinery. Miners are incentivized to continually improve their models to achieve higher accuracy in identifying these elements.


## Core Components

> This documentation assumes basic familiarity with Bittensor concepts. For an introduction, please check out the docs: https://docs.bittensor.com/learn/bittensor-building-blocks.

**Miners**
- Miners are tasked with running binary classifiers that discern between images with and without roadwork, and are rewarded based on their accuracy.
- Miners predict a float value in [0., 1.], with values greater than 0.5 indicating the image contains roadwork.

A unique feature of the Natix Network is its dynamic reward system. Miners must submit their image classification models to a public repository on Hugging Face. The submission is valid for 90 days, during which their reward factor is one. As time progresses beyond this period, the reward factor decays to zero, incentivizing continuous improvement and re-submission of models.

**Validators**
- Validators challenge miners with a balanced mix of real and synthetic media drawn from a diverse pool of sources.
- We continually add new datasets and generative models to our validators in order to maximize coverage of the types of diverse data. Models and datasets are defined in  `natix/validator/config.py`.

- The green arrows show how applications interact with the subnet to provide construction site detection functionality.
- The blue arrows show how validators generate challenges, present miners with images, and score their responses.
