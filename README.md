The Natix Network is a decentralized subnet designed to identify elements of construction sites in images. Built on Bittensor, this subnet incentivizes miners to develop and deploy models that accurately detect construction-related features like road signs, hazard markings, and machinery.

## Decentralized Detection of Construction Site Elements
The Natix Network focuses on detecting elements of construction sites in images, such as road signs, hazard markings, construction materials, and machinery. Miners are incentivized to continually improve their models to achieve higher accuracy in identifying these elements.

## Core Components

> This documentation assumes basic familiarity with Bittensor concepts. For an introduction, please check out the docs: https://docs.bittensor.com/learn/bittensor-building-blocks.

**Miners** 
- Miners are tasked with evaluating images to determine the likelihood of the presence of construction site elements. They provide a float value between 0 and 1 to indicate this probability.
- Miners must submit their models to a public repository on Hugging Face every 90 days to maintain their reward factor.

A unique feature of the Natix Network is its dynamic reward system. Miners must submit their image classification models to a public repository on Hugging Face. The submission is valid for 90 days, during which their reward factor is one. As time progresses beyond this period, the reward factor decays to zero, incentivizing continuous improvement and re-submission of models.

**Validators** 
- Validators present miners with a mix of organic images and randomly selected labeled images to assess their performance. The labeled images help rank miners based on accuracy.

- The blue arrows show how validators generate challenges, present miners with images, and score their responses.
